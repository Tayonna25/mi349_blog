    <p>I think everyone wants to be happy. It seems like everyone is chasing something whether that 
        be a dream, a job, a family, money, or experiences. It all circles back to what is going to make 
        them the happiest or the most comfortable for most. Many social scientists have tried to answer 
        the question: can money make you happy but it has all come down to how you measure 
        happiness and how you define happiness. In a study at University of Michigan when the 
        makings a year started at 100k per year the response of not too happy became non-existent 
        with people making less than 10k per year at 21% not too happy. On a wall street journal from 
        the pre-purchase forecast, people thought happiness would last longer if they bought a material 
        than have been wanting over an experience longer but later in the study it was found a 
        purchase made on experience last way longer. It was also found that buying someone else a gift 
        rather than something for yourself made people happier. The effects of income have not been 
        linear. The cantril ladder ( life elevation ) does continue to increase ( though at a lower rate ) at 
        higher income. More money doesnâ€™t buy more happiness, but less money is associated with 
        emotional pain.</p>
