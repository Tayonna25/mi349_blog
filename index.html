<h3>Do you want to be Happy? Does money make you happy?</h3>


    <p>I think everyone wants to be happy. It seems like everyone is chasing something whether that 
        be a dream, a job, a family, money, or experiences. It all circles back to what is going to make 
        them the happiest or the most comfortable for most. Many social scientists have tried to answer 
        the question: can money make you happy but it has all come down to how you measure 
        happiness and how you define happiness. In a study at University of Michigan when the 
        makings a year started at 100k per year the response of not too happy became non-existent 
        with people making less than 10k per year at 21% not too happy. On a wall street journal from 
        the pre-purchase forecast, people thought happiness would last longer if they bought a material 
        than have been wanting over an experience longer but later in the study it was found a 
        purchase made on experience last way longer. It was also found that buying someone else a gift 
        rather than something for yourself made people happier. The effects of income have not been 
        linear. The cantril ladder ( life elevation ) does continue to increase ( though at a lower rate ) at 
        higher income. More money doesnâ€™t buy more happiness, but less money is associated with 
        emotional pain.</p>

            perfumes and makeup? By entering a phone number and email address Ulta has been thanking 
            its loyal customers or just general customers. They want you to feel loved. The membership is

            bought some of my favorite products like normal and I learned I had 70 dollars to use for my 
            next order. I paid 3 dollars for my order that day and I would say I don't spend a lot of time there. 
            I really appreciate the rewards and felt very loved at Ulta with the free rewards program. </p>
